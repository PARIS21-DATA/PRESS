The software extends the monitoring systems of the target countries. In this way, they can improve monitoring of NDC and REDD+ measures and reporting on GHGs and their reduction.

This global system is managed by the Animal Production and Health Division (AGA). It provides National Coordinators for the Management of AnGR (NC) nominated by countries with a secure means to control the entry, updating and accessing of their national data. Throughout the existence of DAD-IS, population data have been lacking for many breeds. This information is critical for guiding the national management of AnGR and the calculation of SDG Indicator 2.5.2 (SDG = Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 2.5.2 = Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction), for which AGA is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) focal point. As of March 2018, across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 67 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown risk status, 26 percent as at risk, and 7 percent as not at risk of extinction. The main reason for the data gap is lack of population data on country level. Livestock censuses, if carried out at all, are expensive and thus not sufficiently frequent relative to the annual SDG reporting. Moreover, they usually do not provide information on breed level. Therefore, countries need cost efficient solutions allowing them to estimate regularly the population sizes of their AnGR. The project will update a document describing the methodology and adjust a simple data entry tool (access data base tool) allowing estimating the breed population at country level. Remark - All project countries can be found on the DAC list. Therefore, 100 % of the project budget is allocated to ODA.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,1,NA,"2019-01-01",NA,NA,"",NA,"","",0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"","","crs"
