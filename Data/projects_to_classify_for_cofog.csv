This is a grant to the Republic of Congo amounting to UA 791,400 and is financed by the Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF). The proposed technical assistance aims at supporting the efforts of the Congolese authorities to improve public institutional governance through the MPSIR and to enable the authorities to better monitor ongoing reforms and programmes. It will reduce the risks to the implementation of the programme and increase the chances of its success in an unfavourable economic context, but which also offers the country real opportunities to adopt structural reforms capable of sustainably cleaning up the economy and opening the way to successful economic diversification. The project has two components: (i) Support for the improvement of the public investment programming process with a view to providing technical assistance to the MPSIR, which is the ministerial structure responsible not only for steering and coordinating the implementation of the 2018-2022 NDP, but also for carrying out its regalian activities aimed at (a) investment programming and evaluation, (b) economic planning, (c) the production of statistical data, and (d) an endowment of computer and office equipment; (ii) Operationalisation of the project and programme monitoring and evaluation cell.

When reported data raise concern, these are checked at the source. Was it a simple error or is there a healthcare delivery problem? To further improve the quality of data collection at the source, the data officers conduct random verification visits to health centers to compare their reported data with what is written in their original registers. These visits are not meant to be policing but serve to help improve the quality of data. Also, quarterly supervision visits are conducted. After data collection, the data are analyzed and presented in an attractive and understandable way with recommendations for decision making on prioritization, budget allocation, staffing etc. Each quarter a multi-stakeholder meeting at the district level is organized to disseminate important health information and build commitment towards reaching health goals"

Over the past 30 years, the country has been among the most rapidly warming locations on the globe, with temperatures increasing as much as 0.4°C per decade. (South Sudan INC Report 2018). Regional analysis by ICPAC showed that summer rains in South Sudan declined by 15–20 percent, and temperatures rose by >1oC. Rainfall pattern has become increasingly erratic, increasing the incidence of both floods and droughts. Frequency and severity of extreme climate events and depletion of natural resources have increased leading to i) internal conflict among communities as a result of competition for scarce natural resources will increase in certain parts of the country, (ii) water flow in major rivers is reducing and small streams in parts of South Sudan are drying up, thus causing water scarcity, (iii) higher incidences of disease spread such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery as a result of droughts and floods, and (iv) prolonged droughts in addition to human starvation are causing food crises, loss of livestock, internal displacement and migration of people to neighboring countries. 
Droughts, floods, pollution, deforestation, and conflicts have worsened South Sudan’s humanitarian crisis, food insecurity and jeopardize the livelihoods of over 90 percent of the country’s 12 million people (South Sudan State of Environment Report, 2018). The situation is being worsened by the return of over 2 million refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) and migration of pastoralists with their cattle, in search of water and pasture in the dry season invading agricultural land, leading to further tensions and conflicts. These unplanned internal and external migrations of people and their livestock are one of the major sources of conflict in the country as the migratory routes have changed due to conflict - thus causing conflict between the host communities, IDPs, and migrating people at the local levels over access to natural resources. Moreover, due to droughts and floods, people are being internally displaced or migrating to neighboring countries. This human displacement puts further pressure on scarce natural resources. 
The impact of these events is further induced by the vulnerable socio-economic conditions the people live in and by the degradation of and reduction in ecosystem goods and services from natural resources.  
Development partners, including Cordaid, have tried to address the effects of these hazards by supporting the host communities and IDPs to anticipate risks and implement preparedness and mitigation measures, adapt to changing risks, and transform systems and structures to address underlying factors and root causes. One key challenge for farmers and pastoralist communities is the lack of climatic information as well as early warning indicators on rainfall patterns, seasonal forecasts on vegetation coverage, and water source's availabilities especially during the dry season, magnitude, and severity of droughts and flooding. People have to depend on traditional knowledge to anticipate hazard events. 
Thus, the key problems are a high disaster risk due to frequent occurrence of drought, flood and conflict hazard events, high vulnerability due to limited access to water and other natural resources, and livelihood/food insecurity, and an inadequate capacity to manage this disaster risk due to lack of sufficient and reliable data to inform pastoralist about migratory routes, to feed early warning and provide knowledge about appropriate early actions, and to support proper, fact-based, participatory disaster risk analysis and joint action planning."

The lack of data from all geographies is a problem for the analysis of the global spread of COVID-19, how it spreads, the differentiated impact in different populations, its mutations and associations with treatment. Top-level connect of these data is essential to support the fight against the virus. 

The 2014 Ebola crisis and subsequent crises has taught that it is critical to develop long-lasting and durable solutions to strengthen health systems in terms of capacities to prevent, respond and innovate based on scientific understanding.

The project builds on the findings of our three interdisciplinary GCRF projects in India and South Africa, addresses the gap identified in these projects (poor communication between policy makers and the local community and lack of women's participation in energy policy) and aims to maximise their impact.  Energy infrastructure affects women in particular as they are at home more than men, carry out most household practices and are extremely dependant of social networks. In developing countries, women's traditional role at home leads to them having far more influence than men on domestic energy consumption but women's involvement in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7 (energy) and 11 (safe, resilient and sustainable human settlements) remains an under-researched area, especially in the urban context. Our previous research has revealed policy makers' total lack of understanding of women's daily realities in low income settlements in India and South Africa: new energy and housing infrastructure has led to households practices moving from outdoors to indoors, energy intense lifestyle and debt. Predicting the future of energy demand lies in understanding the everyday life that sources domestic energy consumption. Yet approaches to effectively capture the everyday life in domestic environments are a blind spot in current energy research. The challenges are considerable and call for a radical new approach. Film is an art of recording that is always imbued with a pre-existing reality associated with a social and physical context within given cultural, political and environmental circumstances. Cinema is an unused vehicle to study the unravelling of domesticity within dwellings that are notoriously difficult to access given the sociocultural context. The Research Network explores how cinematic analysis and short documentary films could provide crucial new data concerning womens' daily practices and energy use. This could allow us to make recommendations that could result in the creation of more inclusive, affordable and clean energy infrastructure.  This Research Network will address this development challenge specifically by: a) analyzing our existing CineSpaceMuse database on everyday household practices in Indian and African cinema; b) making a series of short documentary films on location in Mumbai and Cape Town; and c) testing the approach on policy makers in a series of workshops in Mumbai, Cape Town and Cambridge. The international collaborators (Indian Institute of Technology/IITB, City of Cape Town, Development Action Group/DAG, Doctors For You/DFU) have been in key role on developing this proposal and identifying development challenges in the field. Their participation in crucial in the workshops, the analysis and dissemination.  The project uses films in two ways. First, by adopting the methodology and the software developed for the AHRC CineMuseSpace project [https://www.cinemusespace.arct.cam.ac.uk]. This part of the study will directly build on our CineGenus project [https://www.cinemusespace.arct.cam.ac.uk/news/cinegenus]. Second, PI and Co-I will make short documentary films (each 2-5min) on location in low income housing in Mumbai and Cape Town that pin down the occupants' daily practices, which interact with energy, mainly electricity. The novelty lies in using the fiction films' data as a reflective tool to map energy consumption patterns which are in sync with daily lives. Short film database, policy briefing and design guidelines for energy infrastructure in low income housing will be written together with all project partners and discussed in the workshops."

It aims to lay the groundwork for challenge-led research that interrogates how datafication is experienced, interpreted and contested in two sectors of everyday life, the public sphere and the informal economy, and in three Eastern African countries: Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. At the core of this network is a partnership structure that includes technical practitioners and researchers at its core. Led by Professor Alcinda Honwana, network partners provide a breadth of sectoral expertise and country-contexts, and research and practitioner perspectives. This Network recognises there are both huge opportunities and challenges around datafication in social and economic activities. In policy and academic domains, attention to the ways public-private partnership can leverage the developmental potential of big data is growing, for example, using data analytics to bring financial services to informal entrepreneurs. Equally, there are strong concerns are voiced over the ways that technology companies harvest and commercialise the data used to 'train' algorithms underpinning their platforms, in ways often unknown to the user. This Network accepts and confronts both of these perspectives, setting up a collaborative structure through which to unpack the multi-dimensional, complex and context specific features of datafication in East Africa. Network partners will operate through three working groups: two sector-focused working groups exploring datafication processes in, first, the public sphere and, second, the economy, and a third working group on Knowledge translation and public engagement. Each working group will cover social science, policy and technical perspectives. The two sector-focused working groups will be tasked with developing frameworks of understanding that take into account five complex and intersecting dimensions of datafication processes: 1) Back end processes; 2) Front end user experiences; 3) Data Governance and management, and their linkages to citizen rights; 4) Organisational structures and practices; and 5) the regional and international context. They will explore these dynamics in their sector area, as well as discuss together at network-wide workshops to consider cross cutting practices and issues. The task of the third working group, in conversation with the other two, will be to set up channels for wider engagement and conversation around the network's conversations, specifically building on the partners' experience and wider positioning. This includes using local-language podcasts to spark conversation, supporting capacity building of youth and students around visualising insights, and creating an interactive online journalism feature. This emphasis on wider engagement is crucial in order to ensure that the network remains driven by and linked in to priorities and challenges around rights on the ground. These efforts will form the foundation for developing collaborative grant proposals to dig deeper into processes of datafication in different contexts, what they mean for digital rights, and how governance, regulation and technical bodies might respond, including possibilities to inform technological development. The concrete outputs of the Network in its first year will be: 1) established and sustainable patterns of working collaboratively; 2) active communication with policy and practitioner bodies in East Africa; 3) new frameworks of understanding of datafication processes in the economy and public sphere; and 4) a concrete and ambiguous grant proposal to extend research and engagement, and inform technological development."

The focus is on low-lying coastal zones that have a high risks of droughts and floods in selected parts of East Africa, Brazil and North America. It develops the geographic and socio-economic knowledge of persons living in slum and riverbed areas by gathering georeferenced data on infrastructures and information on the natural heritage of project sites. The project team will also investigate technology adoption barriers and diffusion drivers through designing and prototyping an affordable, disaster-resilient, low-income housing system that use sustainable locally-resourced materials. The development of urban spaces is a function of geographic location, economic history, urban development pattern, and therefore governance will have a bearing on resilience. Still, given that development (or lack thereof) of an urban center is an outcome of existing social, economic, and political inequities political inequities; policy packages for disaster preparedness that do not consider the unique circumstances of vulnerable populations can inadvertently cause harm to low- income households. Furthermore, policy packages will include environmental sustainability and public health considerations. The research will also contribute to accurate modelling of climate and extreme weather events at spatiotemporal level to increase the understanding of climate scientists while empowering policy makers in disaster related decision-making. Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics will be used for climate modelling and to identify optimal disaster resilient-housing urban design and planning policy packages considering projected climate change- related extreme weather scenarios between the current time and 2050. Whilst Big Climate Data is amenable to long-term climate prediction, data for localized and seasonal predictions is still uncertain and sparse. Machine Learning has potential to handle this uncertainty and data sparsity as other applications have demonstrated that it can work with either big data or sparse data."
"165";"crs_GB-GOV-13-FUND--GCRF-ES_T003936_1";"The 2017 Lancet Series, Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale, estimated that 43% of children under 5 years in LMICs (250m children), were at risk of not reaching their potential because they had stunted linear growth or lived in extreme poverty. The proportion of children at risk increases appreciably when additional risk factors are considered, especially low maternal schooling and child maltreatment. Living in poor and unstimulating conditions affects young children's learning and development. Children exposed to poverty and adversity explore and learn less than children not exposed to these stresses; they learn less at school and achieve fewer school grades; earn less as adults; have more social problems, and poorer physical and mental health. We will study barriers and accelerators to learning in LMIC ECE programmes, at home and in communities, as well as associations between early learning and indicators of child development and  school performance. We will estimate their longer-term effects on education and earnings in adulthood. We will use descriptive and statistical analyses of secondary data collected through representative country surveys and research studies. As an established group of multi-disciplinary and multi-country experts and collaborators, we build on prior success in sourcing and analysing data from 91 LMICs by including early education and expanding to 137 countries. Global data, presented along the continuum of the early years, breaks down the false dichotomy between ECD and ECE, between care and education, and between learning at home and in formal programmes, and supports multi-sectoral actions along different stages of the life-course. We will expand our global analyses of threats to ECD by examining gender, location and wealth, services and family supports for young children, and policies that create facilitating environments for families and children. We will, for the first time, link indicators of the structural quality of ECE (eg teacher-child ratios) to contexts and child outcomes in LMICs. Process quality (eg teacher- and caregiver-child interactions), on which there is as yet no global data, will be studied through case studies in 5 countries, one in each of five regions of the world. We will source data on government, development assistance and household expenditures on pre-primary education; extract further country micro-data on contexts in which young children develop and learn; update nationally representative data on young children, services and policies to the most recent survey dates available, and develop new composite indicators of barriers and accelerators of young children's learning and development. Through partnerships with regional networks of ECD-ECE government and stakeholder teams, the project will help to build research capacity in ECD-ECE, and increase the use of data for decision-making, action and monitoring in 20 countries. We will use the results to provide evidence-based support to engage international human rights law, especially the right to education and the rights of the child, in advancing progress towards achieving the SDG goals of universal access by 2030. This research will address the gap in the evidence base for a unified approach to ECD and ECE. The findings will support the development of the right to education by providing a holistic approach to guide early development and educational interventions. It will demonstrate the strength of interdisciplinary work in cross-fertilizing data analysis and legal research in building strong foundations for translation into policy and regulatory change. Given the evidence on the critical roles of ECD-ECE on learning and wellbeing in the short, medium and longer term, the project has important implications for development and welfare in countries on the DAC list. This large-scale global approach iscritical to support and guide policy and investments."

While these rationales are compelling, the management, curation, and archiving of research data in open repositories is not established practice in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 

This project seeks to strengthen the management and sharing of research data generated through IDRC-funded research projects.

This will involve the development of data management plans, papers describing their data, and the curation of datasets. The process will be guided by international advisors who will help researchers understand the administrative process, ethical considerations, and data curation techniques that support the archiving of research data in open repositories. As researcher practices and infrastructures vary across regions, the project will convene workshops in Africa, Asia, and South America to exchange experiences in the management and sharing of research data in each region. 

Insights from peer exchanges and guidance provided by the international advisors will be used by researchers to publish their data papers and archive their data.

Online gender-based violence (GBV) takes many forms, including harassment, hacking, impersonation, surveillance/tracking, spamming, the non-consensual distribution of intimate photos and messages, and recruiting victims into violent/harmful situations. The prevalence of online GBV is an exacerbating factor in women’s digital exclusion, yet we have limited data on the extent of online GBV, and particularly on what works to prevent it. 

From IDRC-funded research in Latin America, Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, we have a growing body of knowledge on the profound gaps in access, use, and basic skills that are disaggregated by gender. However, in terms of security and safety, rights, participation, and expression, there is a dearth of statistically significant research on how women and LGBTQI communities experience the online world, as well as the levels of harassment and violence they face. For example, female public and political figures from around the world report disturbing levels of abuse on social media platforms. In the Global South, we only have personal accounts of attacks on women, gender-diverse, transgender, and queer populations as they navigate the digital ecosystem. Global South countries are only rarely included in public opinion polling on internet issues, in part because of lower internet penetration rates, and in part because logistical and capacity challenges increase costs. Furthermore, the fast pace of technological change and contextual differences in platforms used in different countries make it challenging to design and evaluate responses that are appropriate to multiple regions and platforms.

This initiative seeks to conduct a statistically significant global survey of people’s experiences online, with a focus on online gender-based violence and deep dives into women’s/LGBTQI+ online experiences in a set of countries in the Global South. Armed with this data, development, private sector, and government actors can better design responses to online gender-based violence by regulating online social media platforms and through education programs and legal recourse.

Data collection is used for targeted marketing or relationship management and to govern patterns of interactions in the marketplace. 

Data protection laws are rapidly emerging throughout Latin America to protect citizens against the potential impacts of platform business practices. However, studying the implementation of these laws or their ability to protect vulnerable populations is difficult because there is little knowledge of how to study “datafication” (the transformation of social action into quantified data) and how it affects local populations.

This project addresses these concerns by developing and applying a set of tools and techniques to audit private sector use of personal data and to produce policy-relevant findings about how the increasing ubiquity of digital platforms affects the delivery of services in the region.

It is expected that the project will strengthen education systems and enhance education sector governance and social accountability to improve access and quality of education. 

The project was selected through a global call, initiated by the Global Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, to learn about scaling proven innovative approaches in education in developing country contexts.

Studies suggest it could support better medical diagnostics, increase agricultural productivity, and improve public service delivery, among other benefits. The creation of high-quality labelled datasets used to train machine learning models has driven progress in artificial intelligence in these domains. Many of these datasets, however, do not represent wide swaths of the population and overrepresent North American and European geographies, species, cultures, and languages. As a result, valuable machine learning tools do not work for the developing world, and some exclude poor and vulnerable communities.

This project will address this problem by funding the creation, expansion, and maintenance of equitably labelled datasets relevant for the Global South. It will also deepen our understanding of how to fund and support the development and maintenance of equitably labelled datasets. Initial datasets will be in the domains of healthcare, agriculture, and local languages. All datasets will be openly available. 

This project is IDRC’s contribution to the Universal Labelling Project, a pooled fund structure that will distribute small grants to support the creation of public interest datasets. The project is a collaboration between the Rockefeller Foundation, Google.org, and IDRC. Meridian Institute, a charitable organization based in the United States, will act as the financial and administrative secretariat for the pooled fund.

Data exists in many countries, but it is not systematically collected, it does not meet international standards, and it is not well-used throughout the education system. Approaches to improving these problems exist, but they have not been scaled across countries. 

This project addresses the lack of “turnkey” education management information systems in the education sector that can be used sustainably and at scale in low-income countries. It aims to strengthen the capacity of ministries of education in Uganda, Togo, and the Gambia to adapt open source health information systems to local and national education sector needs for better policy formulation, planning, and implementation. More specifically, the project seeks to  leverage a proven innovation in the health sector that will effectively enhance demand for data and information use at all levels of the education system, and provide innovations that make the display and interactive use of digital data in management information systems accessible and useful to decision-makers. 

This project will involve an action research approach and it will use community stakeholder mobilization, participatory development of data visualization tools for schools and communities, and test and evaluate innovations in two districts in Uganda.

"316";"crs_XM-DAC-301-2-109446-001";"Globally, 250 million people are on the move and one-third of them are trapped in conflict situations as migrants, refugees, or asylum seekers. Despite these hardships, life in conflict, emergency, and fragile situations continues — people are born, they marry, divorce, and die. Particularly in these contexts, civil registration and identification are vitally important. The hazards faced by people in conflict, emergency, and fragile contexts, including during natural disasters, could weaken or destroy entire civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems and archives, thereby preventing people from receiving the crucial services they rely on, from humanitarian aid to education and job training. Compounding this, CRVS systems are often last on policymakers’ list of priorities, which puts the information and rights of entire generations at risk. 

Even in less drastic circumstances, records are at risk of disappearing in the event of a natural disaster, making it difficult to account for deaths and mitigate the consequences of natural disasters. In all these situations, it is critical that governments have robust disaster risk reduction plans in place to protect records. Protecting CRVS systems must be part of each country’s climate change mitigation and adaptation plans to ensure that natural disasters do not leave multiple generations without access to rights and services. 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, registration and data in real time are becoming more important than ever to correctly track and record the causes of death. 

This project aims to contribute to strengthening civil registration in conflict, emergency, and fragile settings by documenting good practices in this area. This will be done by providing thought leadership, building the capacity of civil registrars and stakeholders in an increasingly fragile world, and contributing to transform the practice in such contexts. To advance knowledge and dialogue, this project will develop a compendium of practices on CRVS in conflict, emergency, and fragile settings; build capacity around the compendium; and disseminate findings in various global forums.

With a decade of programming on data and related topics, IDRC has an opportunity to showcase thought leadership in the field. 

In 2020 and 2021, there will be several opportunities to feed into global and regional agendas focusing on this topic, including the World Bank’s World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives. The UN Secretary General’s 2020 report on digital cooperation says, “The immense power and value of data in the modern economy can and must be harnessed to meet the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals], but this will require new models of collaboration.” IDRC, together with partners, will explore how to better advance an evidence-based agenda that leads to new models of collaboration between government agencies, donors, industry, and civil society to address the complexities of harnessing the value of data for development, while safeguarding against emerging risks.

Over an 18-month period, the project will synthesize and share lessons about data for development, aiming to shape responses to the COVID-19 crisis, influence emerging donor agendas, and support uptake of key lessons in national policy agendas by civil society groups.

There are lessons from epidemics such as SARS-COV-1, H1N1, Zika, and Ebola that point to the need for reliable and timely data. Early steps were taken in these prior epidemics to leverage data from novel sources, including the private sector. In the current context, many data-enabled innovations have been developed to facilitate early detection, contact tracing, quarantine monitoring, and timely interactive public communication. Data-enabled innovations are being used to inform policy relating to isolation and economic lockdowns.

While data is crucial, it is important to ensure appropriate safeguards when dealing with personal data originating either directly from citizens or through the private sector. For example, though there is great value in leveraging personal data held by mobile operators for tracking movement, the Global System for Mobile Communications (the mobile industry association), updated its privacy guidelines for the use of mobile network big data in the context of COVID-19 to protect communication rights.

Past research on Francophone Africa has highlighted the lack of capacity among data producers, particularly governments, to release high quality, timely data about public issues. Many countries still lack foundational legislation, such as right-to-information laws, or a lack of political will to enforce them. There are also concerns about data sharing, power, and privacy. Further, in many cases there is a lack of capacity amongst actors in understanding the potential of sharing data or technical practices in releasing digital open data. 

Another major challenge is a lack of resources to address capacity and skills gaps, as many resources are not available in French and local languages. These capacity challenges have a negative effect on the release of quality open data about government services such as justice, government budgets and spending, agriculture, education, and more. These challenges contribute to a resulting lack of use of open data, despite demand from a range of stakeholders. Nevertheless, where data is available, useful innovations are emerging, such as mapping aid data to increase the efficiency of service delivery. In addition, there have been notable advancements in assessing spending and delivery outcomes on education and health, monitoring public procurement to reduce corruption and increase efficiency of public spending, and driving innovations and economic growth through community mapping and digital innovations.

This project will focus on strengthening the environment for open and shared data to be used for sustainable development in Francophone Africa. It will support multidisciplinary applied research, capacity building, and innovations to support the release and use of data by governments and intermediaries such as technologists, journalists, academics, civil society groups, and rights organizations.

While in 2015-2016 the main countries facing these mixed migration movements were North Macedonia and Serbia, since 2018 migrants have been increasingly transiting through Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Many migrants have been left stranded along the route and consequently facing a number of vulnerabilities. Key concerns in BiH remain the provision of adequate accommodation facilities and capacity gaps in the Service for Foreigners Affairs (SFA) related to the identification, screening and registration of migrants. Regionally, there remains a lack of reliable data on the total number of migrants present in the WB outside of official reception facilities.

Data is one of the most valuable commodities on earth, far surpassing nutmeg or mace in market size.  A lot of data is generated during the production of nutmeg and mace and 'harvesting' this data to be 'processed' and used in the value chain brings great potential value. Smallholder farmers, who hardly produce any data whatsoever, currently underutilize this value. Monetization of data required for supply chain transparency and product traceability data in particular, and for internal and external business processes in general, presents a powerful opportunity for value addition and new farmer income.The project partners will aim to develop interventions to improve such internal and external processes, while putting data autonomy first and offering farmers a fair remuneration for the use of their data. The project is successful if all farmers are digitally included in the value chain and share data for both upstream and downstream partners of Verstegen, up until the end consumers, that can be monetized and directly distributed back to farmers.This two-year nutmeg project is the prelude to making all supply chains traceable to the last mile and product information transparent to consumers, within the coming five years. Specific objectives are to know all farmers by name and engage them through generating a new income stream that should help them towards earning enough for a living income. This is part of a long-term strategy to safeguard the supply of Indonesia’s iconic nutmeg spice, produced sustainably by and for future generations."

Specific objectives:
# To position Oxfam Mexico as an innovative partner who creates bridges between state-of-the-art researchon Big Data and data activism.
# To develop a pilot to promote inclusive public policies with a multidimensional understanding of inequality.
# To insert Oxfam Mexico in the national and international data science and data activism ecosystem.
Methodology: The project will use data from private providers such as Cuebiq, a firm that uses cellular data to map mobility patterns, to measure movements in the city, inspired by the model developed by the MIT Media Lab in their Atlas of Inequality. Additionally, an origin-destination matrix will be generated using metadata from mobile phones (Call Detail Records or CDRs).

"460";"crs_NL-KVK-27108436-A-05786-08:VN";"From March 2015 to March 2018, with the support of EU and Oxfam, the Budget Transparency Coalition (BTAP) has successfully implemented the project ""Promoting transparency and people#s participation in state budget management #. After 3 years of implementation, the project has achieved great results such as some information publicity policies have improved to some extends; Local authorities inHoa Binh and Quang Tri have applied the mechanisms for community involvement in monitoring, and community groups#members have become a positive factor in motivating people to participate in budget monitoring. From April to December 2018, Oxfam continues to support BTAP in replicating the project#s successful lessons to influence at larger-scale.

Regarding supporting people#s participation, until December 2018, 11 core groups have been established (9 groups in Quang Tri and 2 groups in Hoa Binh). New groups# capacity in budget monitoring, analysing, and public investment monitoring has been built through various activities such as trainings and experience sharings. In these activities, older groups have played an active role in guiding and supporting new groups in budget monitoring. With the mechanism in which older groups supporting the new ones, BTAP expects thecommunity monitoring model to be spread naturally and sustainably. In the coming time, BTAP will continue to support the spreading process through initiative funds, sharing experiences in budget monitoring by organizing sharing sessions between old and new groups, or sharing in periodical meeting with Quang Tri provincial Women#s Union, Farmers Association of Hoa Binh province, Hoa Binh provincial Fatherland Front and through social media.In addition, the ""People monitoring budget"" group will be established on Facebook to create a forum for all residents to approach, share experiences and concerns relating to budget monitoring. Via the open forum above, BTAP will promote learning sharing and technical support for people#s participation in budget monitoring.

Regarding governmental support to expand the space for people#s participationin in decision making and monitoring budget implementation, the authorities in Hoa Binh and Quang Tri provinces have developed mechanisms such as the Scoring tools to select public investment projects, Social audit tools to assess the quality of public investment projects, Policy consultations, Community consultation mechanism to manage development budget of commune. Moreover, the People's Councils at all levels in the project area have also improved the effectiveness of policy implementation monitoring. In addition, the opportunity for people to comment and the accountability of People's Committees at all levels have been enhanced through policy dialogues. In the periodfrom April to December 2018, a total of 21 initiatives (11 initiatives were implemented in new districts and new communes) relating to the evaluation of public investment projects, policy dialogues and analysis have been carried out in Hoa Binh and QuangTriprovince. In the 2019-2020 period, BTAP continues to support governments in Hoa Binh and Quang Tri to implement a number of key policy initiatives to create more evidences for central-level policy advocacy. Thus, BTAP will support Mai Chau district People's Council to apply Scoring public investment tools and assist People's Council of Quang Tri province  evaluate the collective economic program.

Regarding promoting social dialogues on budget management, under the revised 2015 State Budget Law, the Government and People's Committees at all levels must publicize their budget estimation before getting approval from the National Assembly or People's Councils. During the reviewing period by the National Assembly and People's Councils, BTAP promotes publicdiscussionand people#s comment on the budget estimation. ""2019 State budget estimation from expert perspective"" seminar was held in Hanoi on October 29, 2018 with a total of 54 direct participants and 25,800 online viewers. There are more than 5,000peopleparticipating in the discussion, learning about the 2019 State budget estimation via website ngansachvietnam.vn and the Vietnam Budget fanpage. Opinions of experts and people on the 2019 State budget estimation were summarized by BTAP and sent to NationalAssembly deputies, the Ministry of Finance, and the Finance and Budget Committee of the National Assembly. MOF#s representative proposed a meeting with BTAP toexplain the contents of  recommendations relating to the 2019 State Budget Estimation.

Regarding monitoring the implementation of budget transparency policy, BTAP has applied the POBI initiative to assess the level of compliance of provincial authorities and MOBI initiative to assess the level of publicity of central agencies for regulationsrelated to budget transparency. The results of the survey were used by the Ministry of Finance to implement numerous strong actions to promote budget disclosure under the 2015 Budget Law. However, the survey only focused on 3 aspects of publicity (i) availability; (ii) timeliness; (iii) the adequacy of the budget documents but have not yet evaluated the quality, usefulness and participation. Therefore, BTAP proposes that these two surveys needto be completed in terms of evaluation criteria and are carried out annually to create a reliable tool promoting information publicity at the local level.

In 2017 and 2018, Oxfam have also supported BTAP to implement a project improving the role of commune health centers to enhance the quality of health servicesforthe poor, women and ethnic minorities in Quang Tri. The project has piloted the result-based financing model (RBF model) at 6 health centers. Although having just been implemented, RBF model has made some initial impacts to improve service delivery qualityof health centers. RBF activities have facilitated community participation in quality assessment/ service delivery scoring of health centers. Based on this assessment, health centers# budget utilization is improved. However, RBF has just beenpiloted ina short period of time, the evidence and policy messages relating to the allocation of grassroots health budgets based on the operation results are stil unclear. Therefore, BTAP suggests that the implementation of RBF in Quang Trineed more time.

Budget isone of the most important content of economic and social management. If managed in a transparent manner, ensuring accountability and efficiency, budget expenditure plays an important role in poverty reduction, social and economic development. Therefore, BTAP will continue to promote transparency and efficiency in budget management with a comprehensive approach from policy improvement, policy implementation monitoring and community participation support. With the above analysis, BTAP proposes tocontinueimplementing the next phase of the project ""Promoting transparency and the people#s participation in state budget management #Expanding period# with the aim of maintaining budget management initiatives, broadening the scope of their impact, andmovingtowardsadvocating institulization into policy solutions for more widespread adoption."

Trusted partners from other countries may be included as agreed by D4C and Voice.DataWise empowers grassroots organisations working at the intersection of LGBTQI, women’sand young people’s rights to use data, design, and storytelling to build and strengthen community,inspire action, and hold power toaccount. After participating in DataWise, organisations will: collect and use data to inform and implement innovative advocacy strategies; transfer newly acquired data skills to their own communities using D4C toolkits andresources; and communicate insights from original data and research online and offline to hyper-local, regional, and global audiences. The eight selected organisations will be split into two cohorts of four. Each cohort will complete a full set of activities thatfall under three streams: “collect”, “coach”, and “communicate”.Collect Eight LGBTQI organisations collaborate with D4C data coaches to identify relevant existing data (“datamaps”) and missing data (“data gaps”). Coaches work with each organisation to co-create an innovative, ethical and secure data collection strategy that generates original data about LGBTQI rights. Outputs Eight documentation packs, each including a data capacity assessment, a data maps and gaps profile, and a three-month data collection plan Eight new datasets collected and up to 40relevant open data sources Coach Up to 16 LGBTQI leaders (two per organisation)participate in D4C’s immersive and interactive three-month DataSkills Fellowship.

They were one of the recipients of Voice 'NOW US AWARD' previously and have now applied for this sudden opportunity grant to address issues around data for people with disability (PWD). They identified this gap as one of the key challenges faced by PWD in accessing social services but more importantly in participating in election. The data collection will identify the PWDs in a particular community and also disaggregate them by type of disability. This will enable INEC officials who has the responsibility of organizing elections in Nigeria, to plan better for the participation of PWDs in each community.

The goal of the Data for Inclusionproject is to increase the participation of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Nigeria#s political and electoral processes by collecting disaggregated data of PWDs and influencing the reduction of physical barriers and stigma that make it difficult for PWDs to participate in elections. The project would collect data of PWDs in 12 states (2 in each geographical zone) and influence INEC, Edo and Ondo state governments to use the data in providing ramps in polling units that are inaccessible to PWDs in these states. IFA andits partners, Network for the Advancement of Rights of Persons with Visible Disabilities (NAPVID) in Edo and the Ondo state Disabled Welfare Agency (ODWA) would recruit PWD leaders in the 266 local governments areas (LGAs) in the 12 states to manually collect these data from local communities and also set up a technological centre to electronically facilitate the collection of the PWD data from most of the urban centres. Massive media sensitization programs would also be conducted to create awareness on how PWDs can send their data into the database.

In the lead up to the governorship elections in both states, IFA and its partners would hold a PWD focused Live TV Manifesto debates for governorship candidates in Edo and Ondo states to provide opportunity for PWD leaders ask for inclusive policies from prospective governors. PWD leaders in all the local governments in both states would be trained on issue-basedapproaches to prepare them for the debates. IFA and its partners would also hold quarterly review meetings in four geographical locations and use lessons learnt in strengthening its strategy on the project. This project would be implemented within 11months period

Specific Objectives of the projectare:

1. Collect PWD disaggregated data and influence institutional reforms in INEC to promote inclusive elections.
2. Empower PWDs in Edo and Ondo state with tools for building active citizens engagements with state executives to foster PWD inclusivepolicies through manifesto debates.
3. Use data to influence the provision of ramps in inaccessible polling units in Edo and Ondo by state executives.
4. Produce an inclusive practice through documentation of outcomes that can be replicated in other parts of the world"

Motivation
ICT and finance play a vital role in food productivity and income. During a visit to the 'Geodata for Inclusive Finance and Food' conference in February 2017 (by NpM, Netherlands Space Office and Rabobank Foundation) we saw many initiatives on Geodata and many suppliers of ICT solutions to agriculture. 
  
Most projects give partial solutions on one aspect of the agriculture production cycle (eg. soil analysis, weather information, plant disease analysis, financial analysis). They usually need a considerable of labour input for data collection and communication with end users. Time and again, they lack possibilities to bring the solution to scale, due to lacking profitability. 
All solutions for agriculture based on new technology encounter a central difficulty in identifying the unique farmer and his/her location. Additionally, the grid of the geodata is still not that advanced that small farmer plots can be located from space. Agriterra works through agricultural cooperatives and farmers organisations. Agriterra would like to know the state-of-the-art suppliers of solutions to agriculture, using ICT and/or geodata and specialized software, as they are in the market and cover together most aspect of the production cycle and crop chain. 
  
We think there are possibilities to bundle solutions as provided by service providers and supplying and off-taking companies in the chain, and chain partners themselves into a profitable business plan.
  
Agriterra is not yet familiar with the possibilities, but we see the urgency and need to start to work in this area as well, to improve the livelihood of the smallholder farmers. We would like to introduce these new ICT technologies via Agriterra to the cooperatives and farmer organisations who we work with. 
  
Which IC Technology suppliers can we work with? in order to reach all our farmers in the 14 focus countries of the current Agriterra programme.

Phase I ran between 2015 and 2019 and this second phase is now aiming at consolidating and developing the capacity and knowledge acquired by the participating Somali authorities in the first phase.

This will be done by continuing to support the Somali statistical authorities. The overall objective of the project is thus to:

Strengthen the statistical capacity in Somalia in order to facilitate decision-makers' awareness, understanding and confidence in statistical data.

The project's expected results are:

1) Improved quality in the production of social and economic statistics.
2) Improved and strengthened capacity among the statistical authorities in the statistical method.
3) Increased access to high quality statistics and data.
4) Improved and strengthened planning and organization of the statistical authorities.

This second phase is expected to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of the Statistics Office of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and of the Statistics Office of Puntland. Somaliland has been part of phase I of this effort and the ambition is to have them included again in this second phase.

Belowground organisms are an important component of biodiversity, contributing to the functioning and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, yet they are often neglected in conservation planning and resource management. In this project, we aim to determine whether there is a link between belowground biodiversity and productivity based on a gradient of crop and forest productivity inferred from traditional knowledge. This will be achieved along with promoting research and capacity building regarding the role of belowground diversity for forest and crop productivity in W. Africa. We leverage ethnopedological knowledge in the region to infer productivity trend, soil types and land-use change history. Using these data as metadata and for selecting study sites, we will employ state-of-the-art methods to examine belowground diversity and mycorrhizal colonization rates in relation to productivity and land-use change history. This project represents major steps towards addressing the question of how belowground diversity can contribute to sustainable use of land resources and how we can leverage the rich traditional knowledge of the ecosystem in the region for this purpose."

"500";"crs_SE-0-SE-6-14021A0101-RSS-23210";"A results objective of many of Sweden’s development cooperation strategies is to increase production and access to renewable energy. An important constraint in the quest to achieve a significant scale up of investments in distributed supply of renewable energy services is a lack of high quality, reliable and up-to-date data and information on rural and peri-urban parts of Africa and Asia.

This data is crucial for businesses and investors to make decisions about entering markets and tailor their offering to local conditions, and for governments and development stakeholders to design policy and plan action.

Data on customer willingness and ability to pay is particularly crucial (and particularly difficult to obtain), as clean energy technology sold on a pay-as-you-go basis requires a much more complex and long-term relationship between vendor and customer than, for example, selling candles would. Traditional financiers would never consider providing a loan to a customer with no bank account or credit rating, but off-grid energy service providers do not have a choice. This situation requires new ways of operating, which makes off-grid energy service providers risky in the eyes of investors.

The role of data in modern economies today can hardly be overstated. Rich data ecosystems in industrialised countries have fed astonishingly, and increasingly, sophisticated analytics. For over a decade, data analytics have been the lifeblood of investment decisions, product testing and launches, market entries and expansions, and other processes in nearly every sector of modern economies. In 2020, an absence of data translates to a surfeit of risk, and ultimately inertia.

Beyond the private sector, data is also underutilised by developing country governments and development agencies in planning policies and interventions, leading to inefficient planning, sub-optimal decision-making, and inadequate outcomes. OECD country governments use vast amounts of data for purposes ranging from optimising bus routes to predicting flu epidemics. 

The effects of any intervention, whether it is a change in traffic light patterns or a new approach to public information campaigns on flu shots, can be measured and responded to in real time. Developing country governments tend to miss out on these opportunities due to both a lack of reliable data and a lack of funding for programmes and systems to collect, manage and analyse data.

Africa’s data ecosystem is perhaps the world’s most underdeveloped. As the Data for African Development Working Group pointed out in its 2014 Final Report, “nowhere in the world is the need for better data more urgent than in Africa, where data quality is low and improvements are sluggish, despite investments from country, regional, and international institutions to improve statistical systems and build capacity.” 

Through the Beyond the Grid Fund for Zambia contribution funded by the Swedish Embassy in Lusaka, the implementing partner Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) and Sweden have established a first version of a data platform that provides real-time, unique and detailed data on energy use and financial transactions involving more than 150,000 customers living beyond the reach of the national electricity grid - the system is called Energy Data on Off-grid Energy Networks System (Edison). The EDISON software platform handles automated data collection, storage, access, analysis and visualization to verify the installation and use of solar systems under BGFZ's performance-based financing mechanism. Analyses based on EDISON also feed into the dialogue platform established by the Ministry of Energy in Zambia that brings together Zambian authorities, donors, development banks and energy services companies in Zambia.

An expansion of the results-based financing mechanism tested in Zambia is now applied in the new contribution Beyond the Grid Fund for Africa, where the Nordic Environment Financing Corporation is the agreement partner. This will provide the opportunity to collect similar data in Burkina Faso, Liberia and Mozambique reaching an additional 1 to 3 million customers. 

At the same time, a number of additional public and private stakeholders with activities linked to the ""off-grid"" sector have shown great interest in collaborating around Edison in collecting, processing, storing, analyzing and visualizing data in the context of other off-grid programs and financing mechanisms and thereby increase the amount of data available for analysis. 

In November 2019, the Swedish Embassy in Nairobi hosted a roundtable to explore, together with a number of stakeholders, opportunities for collaboration between actors who collect and use big data for development purposes and interest in further developing and making EDISON available as a tool for more stakeholders to use and collaborate around.

REEEP has subsequently submitted an application amounting to 5 MSEK for support, in collaboration with, among others, the Africa Mini-Grids Develompent Association (AMDA), the Global Off Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Sustainable Energy for All, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Energy Sector Managment Assisance Program at the World Bank (ESMAP), The Global Energy Data Commons (GEDC), to further develop and make EDISON available to a wider group of stakeholders.

REEEP has applied to Sida for funding of 476 316 EUR to carry out the ""Edison II - Building and integrated energy data ecosystem for Africa"" during the period 2020-2021. 

The intervention aims at further develop the data collection, storage and analysis platform, EDISON, to make it available for use by a broader range of actors by 1) harmonising data and KPIs of key stakeholders for household solar energy systems and mini-grid solutions for inclusion in specifications of EDISON II and development of a proof-of-concept investment instrument suitable for emerging economies with tranched risk tiers and associated returns; 2) Development, launch and testing of EDISON II energy monitoring and analytics platform and 3) Discussion and documentation of Global Energy Data Commons infrastructure; proposal-writing and fundraising for Energy Data Roadmap for Africa (incl. side-event at SEforAll Forum 2020); facilitation of standardized dataset development for SDG7 tracking.

REEEP will lead the implement the contribution but also engage primary partners AMDA, GOGLA and IEA to participate in working sessions on the KPI harmonisation. It is also anticipated that SNV will be engaged around how to use EDISON in the DFID funded BRIHLO programme in Mozambique. 

The intervention’s total budget is 476 316 EUR, out of which the organisation’s own funding is approximately 15 000 EUR. IEA is expected to cover their own costs of participating in the intervention."

the rate of sustainable development is too slow and that businesses need to
play a major role in ensuring that it speeded up. Paragraph 67 of the 2030 Agenda
and the Paragraph 133 of the New Urban Agenda both call for businesses to apply
their creativity and innovation to solve sustainable development challenges.
Sustainable Development Goal 17 encourages effective public-private
partnerships and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda contains commitments at the
highest political level to: “… develop policies and, where appropriate,
strengthen regulatory frameworks to better align private sector incentives with
public goals, including incentivizing the private sector to adopt sustainable
practices, and foster long-term quality investment.”

The 2017 Report of the High-Level Independent Panel to Assess and
Enhance the Effectiveness of UN-Habitat recognizes that most of the current
investment in urban areas comes from the private sector and corporate interests
and that the UN system must ensure that both public and private investment is
subject to democratic oversight, protects the commons and respects human
rights, and that it is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
and the Sustainable Development Goals. Since the private sector plays such a
large role in urban development, often with negative consequences, especially
for excluded groups, the Panel recommends that UN-Habitat explore ways to
encourage private sector actors to look at the unintended negative impacts of
their investments and find ways to mitigate them. 

UN-Habitat’s Strategic Plan 2020-2023 calls for a rethink regarding
engagement with the private sector to leverage investments in sustainable
urbanization and to promote more appropriate models of development.
Particularly within Outcome 1.3 - Effective settlements growth and regeneration,
and Outcome 2.3 - Frontier technologies and innovation, the Plan considers it
important that UN-Habitat strengthen its engagement with the private sector,
including ICT companies. 

This project, then, provides a significant opportunity to work with a
global business that is committed to aligning its business objectives with the
Sustainable Development Goals, and specifically the Datacenters Community
Development team which sees the sustainability of datacenter communities as a
key element of its core business. In Microsoft’s own words ‘In over 10 years of
building and managing our cloud infrastructure, we have come to understand that
proactive urban planning is also a critical component to the long-term
viability, growth, and social contribution of datacenters as social,
environmental and economic assets to their host communities versus burdens on
them.’ 

Microsoft’s has three datacenter community development objectives:


 Building community partnerships that deliver economic, social,
     liveability and environmental benefits
 Improving the quality of conversations between community
     leaders, organizations, and Microsoft
 Developing a strong,
     technically-skilled, and diverse local workforce


The purpose of the project is to develop an urban planning model
that can help Microsoft achieve these three objectives and make its datacenters
more integrated with the local communities which are hosting them. UN-Habitat
will use its 40+ years of experience of public participation, urban planning,
governance and research to support these objectives. 

Beyond Microsoft UN-Habitat will develop standards, guides and approaches that improve the sustainability of the
industry as a whole, while retaining the economic benefits that come with
datacenter development: the average U.S. large datacenter generates $7.8
million in annual wages and $77.7 million in construction phase wages (2016, US
Chamber of Commerce).

In 2017 there were an estimated 8.6 million datacenters across the
world (International Data Corporation), emitting about 2% of global greenhouse
gas emissions (UNFCCC, 2016) and accounting for 17% of the ICT sector’s carbon
footprint (Colocation America, 2018). With global IP traffic worldwide expected
to treble between 2017 and 2022, datacenter development will keep growing and
expand globally. With the industry’s growth, so will its waste and particularly
e-waste. Datacenter servers have to be replaced every 3-5 years and disposed
electronics worldwide already account for 2% of solid waste and 70% of toxic
waste (World Economic Forum, 2019). In this context, beyond Microsoft there is
a great opportunity for UN-Habitat to develop standards, guides and approaches
that improve the sustainability of the whole industry."

DDG will deploy mobile survey, clearance and risk education capacities that will be roving across Leer County (specific areas of intervention to be determined through survey) to enhance safety and freedom of movement across Leer County, prioritising tasks which will support the overall famine response in the area. Capacity on the ground will consist of one combined roving Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Non-Technical Survey (NTS) and Risk Education (RE) team. These respective activities are further elaborated below:

	NTS – to target and prioritise clearance according to humanitarian need, survey will be conducted using a mixture of key informant interviews and household questionnaires held with the local population and authorities. NTS will determine the likely locations and density of ERW contamination  in target locations, whilst assessing the impact of these hazards on famine affected populations in any given location
	EOD – once NTS has determined the nature of the threat, technical capacities within the team will be deployed to remove and destroy identified hazards
	RE – the team will contain a small capacity to deliver risk messaging raising awareness about how to recognise dangerous items, as well as associated safe practices that should be followed, and high risk behaviour that should be avoided in relation to ERW. 

These activities will be conducted primarily to benefit 8,000 famine and conflict affected people in Leer County, with a special emphasis on vulnerable individuals attempting to access humanitarian services being delivered under the Southern Unity famine response. To this end, key stakeholder s with whom DDG will coordinate / provide support include identified partners that have committed to delivering static or mobile interventions in Leer, namely the 14 non-mine action partners that have been identified in the latest Southern Unity Response Matrix (circulated on 29 March 2017 by UNOCHA).

 RE – both teams will contain a small capacity to deliver risk messaging raising awareness about how to recognise dangerous items, as well as associated safe practices that should be followed, and high risk behaviour that should be avoided in relation to ERW.

As the project start date is towards the end of the rainy season, Maban will be prioritised in the early stages of the project, and both DDG teams funded under this project will be based there initially. Maban’s road infrastructure, soil type and geographical relief mean that the rains will not have a significant impact on operations there. Once the rains have subsided towards the end of 2018, one combined EOD, NTS and RE team will move from Maban to Fashoda County, at which point activities will be implemented simultaneously in both locations until the project end. Moving between these two locations will enable activities to be implemented immediately in Maban, while also enabling this project to have the greatest possible impact in Fashoda County - a hard-to-reach, underserved location with high rates of contamination and a sizable IDP population.

Due to the current volatile nature of the security situation in Maban, DDG requests flexibility to adjust the implementation plan as the project progresses, in order to mitigate risks to project implementation and deliverables resulting from insecurity in operating environments. If the security situation does not allow for the deployment of both teams to Maban at the project start on 1st September, DDG will instead deploy both SSHF-funded teams to Fashoda at the project start, where they will operate until Maban becomes accessible."

 EOD – once NTS has determined the nature of the threat, technical capacities within the team will be deployed to remove and destroy identified hazards. The MTT can split its technical capacity into two separate EOD sub-teams to adopt a more flexible, mobile approach that can address explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) spot tasks, as well as limiting staff exposure to security risks by remaining highly mobile.
 RE – the team will contain a capacity to deliver safety messaging raising awareness amongst at-risk population groups about how to recognise dangerous items, as well as associated safe practices that should be followed, and high risk behaviour that should be avoided in relation to ERW.

DDG has extensive experience operating in Wau, on which it will draw in the implementation of this project. Immediately upon the project commencing, DDG’s MTT will be deployed to Wau Town, where a light base camp will be established and training/accreditation will commence. The MTT will primarily be comprised of existing DDG staff in order to avoid delays relating to recruitment, and assets currently on standby (including 4 Landcruisers - 2 of which will serve as safety vehicles - and a UNIMOG truck) will be moved to Wau to enable the team MTT to rapidly commence activities. Though based out of Wau Town, the team will be highly mobile, roving across Wau and Jur River Counties, both of which remain highly contaminated and have sizable IDP populations.

As the project start date will be in the wet season, locations in Wau and Jur River Counties that are accessible from Wau Town will be prioritised in the early stages of the project. Several such areas remain heavily contaminated with cluster munitions and other ERW, which pose an imminent and significant risk to IDPs and Host Community living or transiting through in these locations. In the dry season, activities will begin in locations further from Wau Town with high rates of contamination. DDG will continue tracking the broader humanitarian response in Wau and Jur River Counties as well as contextual developments that lead to changes in civilian population movements, in order to ensure that areas of operations are prioritised based on continuously evolving civilian and humanitarian needs in the target counties."

This contributes to uncoordinated, incomplete or inaccurate cross-cutting data. In the absence of complete data to inform policy-makers, donors, and implementing partners’ decisions, the risk of inappropriate or inefficient allocation of resources is high, and has an impact on the quality and scope of the humanitarian assistance. In light of the above, the proposed project aims at continuing to provide a solid basis for comprehensive multi-sector programs to be implemented in Afghanistan. ACF considers that this can be done through the regular collection of relevant data that are informative, harmonized, updated, reliable as well as effectively and efficiently disseminated. An important feature is the capacity of multi-sector actors to conduct quality coordinated assessments on a regular basis, while advocating for these findings to be taken into consideration during decision/policy making processes. ACF will focus on dissemination of the surveys’ findings within the concerned actors, as timely information sharing is the main way to enhance coordination and strategic planning of the humanitarian intervention, and avoid overlapping, gaps, and the waste of precious resources. This project is aimed as a continuation of strengthening the coordinated assessments, with the adoption of multi-sector standardized methodologies to collect and analyze indicators from multiple sectors in a timely, accurate and reliable way to inform action and program design at 2 critical levels: at the provincial level, where they will help inform the right combination of responses and at the national level, where they will highly contribute to the national level 2017 and 2018 HNO’s mapping of vulnerabilities and needs, and costs estimation
Strategically, these integrated assessments are expected to substantially contribute to the Nutrition, WASH, FSAC and Health clusters by providing key information and data that can be used for decision making
ACF will support local BPHS partners in the conduction of 4 Integrated SMART surveys and 6 SQUEAC surveys in 4 priority provinces and 6 priority provinces with SAM and MAM programs within the next 12 months starting in October 2016. ACF also aims to strengthen the capacity of key stakeholders and implementing partners on Nutrition assessments (SMART amp SQUEAC) through formal classroom training and on-the-job trainings offered at national and provincial primarily targeting a national institution (Central Statistics Organization for Afghanistan) and field level staff, while providing direct technical and financial support for the implementation of the integrated surveys/evaluations.

All three agencies are experienced demining agencies that have worked in Afghanistan for the past three decades, conducting manual and mechanized mine clearance, survey, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and explosive ordnance risk education (EORE).

As the only implementation partner accredited to conduct Victim Operated Improvised Explosive Device (VOIED) clearance in Afghanistan, HALO Trust will work with DAFA and MCPA to build the capacity of MAPA surveyors in non-technical survey (NTS) of Abandoned improvised Mines (AIMs) (also referred to as VOIEDs). The project will use a team structure that pairs experienced HALO staff with MAPA surveyors to give on-the-job training while conducting survey of hazardous areas and providing risk education to affected populations. The teams will be jointly staffed resulting in a balance of personnel on every survey team. Each team will include HALO AIM NTS team leaders and one deminer-medic, while the AIM NTS assistant team leaders and one deminer-medic will be provided by DAFA or MCPA. Where mixed gender teams are used, the HALO deminer-medic position will be filled by a female MRE assessor. 

Current security assessments suggest that this project could support 2 mixed-gender survey teams. These teams will be deployed in accessible districts, and will include male-female couples (either husband-and-wife or brother-and-sister), and will allow the project to provide stronger returns from this project. These stronger returns are likely to be realised through more complete survey, as gender-roles mean that females in a community may identify different risk areas for survey than males, and through improved provision of risk education to local communities. 


These specially formed teams will 
-	conduct non technical survey (NTS) of hazardous areas identifying land contaminated by AIM/VOIEDs 
-	Collect accurate information on mine/ERW/VOID contamination in the planned districts as well as victim information. 
-	Marking of hazardous areas identified during survey to deter civilian entrance and reduce risk of accidents.
-	Provide Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) for at-risk populations in the planned districts to raise awareness of the risks and provide critical information on safe behaviour that can reduce the likelihood of accidents.
-	Deliver thorough and robust community liaison, hiring eight community mobilisers to fully integrate with affected communities. Teams will document the process in line with Afghan National Mine Action Standards (AMAS) 

The above activities will inform at-risk populations of hazardous areas and of safe behaviours when living with the threat of explosive ordnance, enabling them to avoid accidents and to stay safe. The capacity development element will increase the ability of MAPA to survey and mark AIM/VOIDs hazardous areas in accordance with HALO’s accredited standard operating procedures, therefore increasing MAPA ability to save more lives

To meet the urgent need to raise awareness on COVID-19 facts, as elaborated in the Afghanistan multi-sector HCP, in coordination with MoPH, WHO, and the COVID-19 Risk Communication Working Group, DTM will capitalize upon its extensive network of 62,000 community leaders and change agents and outreach to over 11,700 villages nationwide to implement Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities, e.g.deliver COVID-19 IEC materials, mobilize community and religious leaders, and conduct sessions on risk awareness, infection prevention and control, and counteracting misinformation and stigma. Additionally, to inform better-targeted, evidence-based health response and recovery programming, DTM will also link mobility and surveillance data by simultaneously conducting Baseline Mobility Assessments (BMA) and Community-Based Needs Assessments (CBNA) to identify locations at potentially greater risk of cross-border transmission of COVID-19, as a result of the recent influx of Afghans returning from high-burden areas in Pakistan and Iran. Under other donor funding, DTM has already been implementing this activity in 25 provinces, since 1 March 2020. With AHF funding, DTM will extend coverage to six of the nine remaining provinces, deploying 6 DTM teams to conduct RCCE and BMA + CBNA in Kapisa (2 staff), Paktika (3 staff), Paktya (4 staff), Samangan (2 staff), Uruzgan (2 staff) and Zabul (4 staff).

In response to more frequent openings of borders to allow stranded Afghan migrants to return, DTM will leverage its well-established information systems and operational capacity to rapidly monitor and report cross-border population movements to identify destination areas at greater risk of cross-border transmission of COVID-19, which will inform better-targeted, evidence-based health response and recovery programming. Through AHF funding, DTM will implement flow monitoring at points of entry and major transit hubs, deploying four teams of 7 DTM enumerators at the four border provinces of Herat, Nimroz, Kandahar and Nangarhar. As a contingency, these teams will be mobile and responsive to any mass influx or migration abroad that may emerge in other provinces. Furthermore, as front-line responders, DTM flow monitoring teams will also support the screening of presumptive COVID-19 cases and provide essential risk awareness and infection prevention messaging, as well as identify and refer those migrants in need of immediate health care and protection assistance.

In order to better understand mobility patterns and dynamics within Afghanistan (currently non-existent), with AHF funding, DTM proposes to conduct participatory Population Mobility Mapping (PMM) exercises and Flow Monitoring, deploying teams of 9 DTM enumerators specifically in five areas of high incidence or outbreak of COVID-19. PMM aims to identify high-risk mobility corridors, communities, and Spaces of Vulnerability (SOVs) where mobile populations and local communities interact. Following a standardized methodology established by IOM’s Global Migration Health Unit (MHU), through PMM, communities and partners then jointly develop strategies, response plans, and accountability systems to strengthen of local health systems to mitigate the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 and contain potential and ongoing outbreak.

This proposed intervention will be implemented around two axes:
-	The Mobile Health Teams will be implemented in Jawand and Bala Murghab districts of Badghis Province for the Nutrition part, Western Region
-	The Rapid Nutrition Assessments (RNA) will be launched in the allocation priority areas for assessments, i.e Sar-e-Pul and Faryab (Northern Region), Wardak (Central Region), and Farah (Western Region) provinces (locations to be confirmed with Nutrition Cluster)

Badghis Province is, according to several assessments done in Afghanistan (HNO/HRP 2020, IPC, Smart Surveys) one of the most affected provinces in terms of undernutrition. According to the SMART survey conducted by ACF in 2019, chronic malnutrition (expressed by HAZ) (31.6% (26.3-37.4 CI95%) was considered ‘Very high’ (=30 %) according to WHO (World Health Organization) cut-offs and Poor rate of GAM by WHZ (9.9% (7.6-12.8 CI 95%) which is considered as ‘Medium’ (between 5% and 10%) by WHO cut-offs. GAM by MUAC (10.1% (7.6-13.3 CI 95%) and combined GAM (15.6% (12.6-19.2 CI 95%) were categorized at serious level which indicates a significant number of children with acute malnutrition. Also, under-nutrition among pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) based on MUAC lt230mm 24.8%. A situation which is likely to deteriorate with the impact of the conflict and poor access to health facilities. 
Thanks to multiple assessments, the nutrition situation is monitored and evaluated regularly up to district level in Afghanistan, and this permits to qualify it as worrying. Most nutrition assessments are done by key Nutrition NGO although SEHATMANDI IP need to be empowered to do so. Indeed, according to the 2010 BPHS guidelines, implementing partners bear the primary responsibility for conducting regular nutrition assessments to estimate the prevalence of under­nutrition as well as conducting Rapid Needs Assessment. However, very few SEHATMANDI partners have conducted nutrition surveys, for (i) lack of ownership of the nutrition package, (ii) lack of financial resources, and (iii) lack of technical capacity. Therefore, for nutrition assessments to effectively support prioritization of resources and informed programming decisions, it is recommended that they be conducted at least once a year. In Afghanistan however, due to lack of financial resources and technical capacity, nutrition surveys are conducted on a multi­year basis, which significantly undermines their contribution to ensuring that the national nutrition response is meeting the needs of the population.
To address the acute needs of vulnerable malnourished girls, boys and women, AAH will provide nutrition services through the setup of Mobile Health Teams (MHTs) targeting boys, girls and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) in the selected locations. These Mobile Health Teams will also have a health component with the provision of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) for boys and girls 0-59 months and provision of i Antenatal Care (ANC) to pregnant women, Post Natal Care (PNC) to women after delivery and  and family planning services to women of reproductive age (15-49 years old). 
To support the humanitarian response planning based on accurate and updated nutrition data, AAH will conduct 4 RNA referring to rapid SMART methodology in hard to reach districts, focusing especially on Sar-e-Pul, Wordak, Faryab and Farah provinces considered as priority areas. RNA not only will respond to information needs of emergencies but will also inform follow up large scale and full SMART surveys which could be conducted in the future."

With increasing displacement throughout the country due to the worsening drought and on-going conflict along regional and external border areas, ensuring continued and timely information dissemination on the urgent needs of displaced populations remains a priority of the Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian community. 

The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has been tasked by the Ethiopian Humanitarian Country Team (EHCT) to regularly track, map and report on internal displacement through the implementation of its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) tool. IOM’s DTM programme is implemented in collaboration with the national Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC), regional, zonal and woreda counterparts and implementing partners the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Ethiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS).

In September 2016, IOM scaled up its institutional capacity and operational presence throughout the country with nation-wide DTM rolled out every two months (“Round”). DTM round assessments are conducted at Zone, Woreda and site level. Under the present project, IOM will continue conducting Baseline Area and Location Profiling (Zone / Woreda) as well as IDP Site Assessments further outlined below:

1)	Baseline Area Profiling and Baseline Location Profiling

Baseline Area and Location Profiling will be conducted to establish baseline information of IDPs across the country. The information will be collected from local key informants and the information gathered will include estimation of existence and number of the displaced populations at Zone (Baseline Area) and Woreda (Baseline Location) level disaggregated by type of temporary settlements as well as approximate locations of identifiable displacement sites. 

2)	IDP Site Assessment (Protection Enhanced)

In-depth IDP Site Assessment will be conducted based on the information gathered through the Baseline Location Porfiling. All displacement sites identified through Baseline Location Profiling will be targeted for IDP Site Assessments where data will be collected from key informants at site level.  

Each round of DTM will result in the production and dissemination of a national-level dashboard and regional reports. The information will be supplemented by IOM’s Emergency Tracking Tool (ETT) which captures new displacements between published rounds and is disseminated to partners.

Within the proposed project, the information gathered through two rounds of DTM will aim to assess the humanitarian multi-sectoral needs of approximately 700,000 internally displaced individuals. To achieve this, IOM will roll-out DTM every two months in collaboration with the Ethiopian Red Cross Society and Danish Refugee Council (with already existing partnership arrangements), IOM data enumerators and regional DTM assistants. During the collection of data, IOM will continue to implement its Emergency Tracking Tool (ETT) to provide a steady flow of information on new displacements to inform and enable humanitarian partners for immediate response.

These threaten the lives of a wide range of ordinary citizens, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) and young children, and would surely pose a considerable hindrance to the rehabilitation efforts of communities in the future. The escalation in fighting has also caused thousands to flee their homes in Aleppo and Idleb in the past year. In the two governorates, there are over two million IDPs, many of whom have fled to mine/ERW-contaminated areas. The impact of these explosives on IDPs and host communities is significant. However, as there is no systematic recording of mine/ERW accidents, even mine action actors are unable to accurately define the level of impact or identify the specific kinds of threats and injuries, thereby not being able to plan effective mitigation. Therefore, under the proposed project, AAR, in cooperation with a National Syrian NGO, will conduct systematic data collection on the casualties of mine/ERW accidents in the target sub-districts in western Aleppo and Idleb. The initial data will be collected from local authorities and medical facilities, and subsequently the data collection teams will conduct house-to-house visits of the casualties listed in the initial data for interviews in order to record more in-depth and standardised information of each casualty and accident. The compiled information will inform the humanitarian communities of the prevalence and nature of the mine/ERW accidents, as well as the location and type of injuries of the casualties. Furthermore, as a mitigation element, the project will provide 13,476 persons with Risk Education (RE) in collaboration with another National Syrian NGO through conducting sessions, so that they have adequate knowledge and skills to protect themselves from explosive threats. RE teams will ensure to reach out to children and IDPs, as they are particularly vulnerable to mine/ERWs risks. The contents of the RE sessions will be tailored to different demographic characteristics and local needs through field-testing the session with audiences disaggregated by gender, age, and IDP status. RE teams will reach out to families in their homes, schools, and places of work with safety messages."

The teams will travel around Rural Damascus providing school-age children with lectures and recreational activities to inform them about ERW, as well as distributing RE material in the form of handouts, crayons, notebooks and other school material. They will also provide RE material to the older generation, putting up posters about the ERW risks in besieged rural communities to increase the awareness of ERW threats. Teams will concurrently visit local hospitals and medical centers, interviewing survivors, doctors, nurses, patients and community members in order to gather ERW victims/survivors data and map it using remote survey software.
 
The project is therefore an educational campaign which will protect communities in Duma, Harasta, Nashabiyeh, Arbin, Kafr Batna and Maliha by informing them about the dangers of ERW, and will also form a base network for data recording and further support for ERW victims/survivors from Rural Damascus. Three teams of five, each consisting of two groups of two and a team leader, will provide two sessions a day four days a week, to groups of approximately 20 children.  Each of the 15 members of staff involved will attend four training days on safeguarding, child protection and psycho-social support awareness, and from the beginning of the school year on 15 September to its end on 30 April (omitting three weeks holiday) the groups will each enact the project across Rural Damascus. Over the course of 28 weeks the teams will directly reach an estimated 26,880 children, and 53,991 people in total.
 
The RE part of the project provides two main activities. The first RE activity is delivery of lectures and recreational programs to groups of teachers and students these will form a curriculum for mines and ERW awareness in schools. The curriculum contains lessons and planned activities and games which will raise children's awareness of ERW and their ability to identify them and act safely around them. Rural Damascus is mostly contaminated with ERW rather than landmines in this environment the curriculum will prioritize and concentrate its focus on ERW, cluster bombs, unexploded barrel bombs and other relevant hazardous items. Teams will provide the targeted schools with training and booklets containing this curriculum, and thereby try to  integrate education about ERWs and living safely with ERWs into the school program so that children will internalize the information rather than just recall it. HALO and Shafak organisations feel that ERWs are a long-term problem, and that as such, long impact approaches for children must be sustained. The second RE activity is distribution of leaflets and posters with basic instructions about the avoidance of ERW, including information about Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and precautions to be taken, to parents and to communities in coordination with local councils.
 
The second part of this project is ERW victim/survivor data collection and the facilitation of psycho-social support provision to the victims/survivors. Team members will visit every accessible hospital and medical center, and gather available and relevant data about the victims/survivors of ERW accidents, using specifically designed questionnaires to ensure the consistency of the data. The information collected will be recorded into a database which will be designed using HALO’s experience of survivor interviews and ERW mapping, and Shafak's experience within Syria of data collection and remote monitoring through it information will be made available to share with other humanitarian actors, particularly those offering psycho-social support and direct Victim Assistance (VA). Data collected, especially the location of accident and type of ERW, will then be used as an additional tool to plan ERW clearance in the future."

HALO proposes that RE activities continue on and that both Contamination and Casualty Data Gathering are conducted by existing teams. Additionally, HALO proposes that the teams conduct protection monitoring in all proposed areas.  

Under the current project, HALO and its implementing parner, Shafak, are providing ERW-RE to children in the communities of Duma, Harasta, Nashabiyeh, Arbin and Kafr Batna. Because ERW’s are a long term problem, both HALO and Shafak believe that long impact approaches for children must be sustained the more a child is taught safe behaviours, the more likely it is that they will become ingrained in their day-to-day activity. 

Under the ERW-RE part of the project, 3 teams of 5, each consisting of 2 groups of 2 and a team leader, who have already been trained by HALO, will target locations in Rural Damascus providing school-age children with RE activities, and materials  to  inform them about dangers of ERW. They will also provide RE material to the older generation, putting up posters about the ERW risks in besieged rural communities to increase the awareness of ERW threats. Schools and locations that were not reached in previous messaging will be the first priority. 

In addition to RE, HALO proposes that teams begin gathering data on contamination and causalities with the use of Kobo. This will require technical training which will be provided via Skype from HALO’s office in Gaziantep, Turkey. The teams will gather data by talking to local councils, hospitals and medical centres, who will direct them to affected families and communities. The information collected will be recorded into a database already designed using HALO’s experience of survivor interviews and ERW mapping, and Shafak's experience within Syria of data collection and remote monitoring through it information will be made available to share with other humanitarian actors. Data collected will then be used as a tool to plan ERW clearance in the future.

Two of the four members in each team will be trained in protection monitoring and conduct monitoring activities. These will be both observational surveys and Key Informant Interviews as developed by the Protection Monitoring Task Force (PMTF), and ad hoc/rapid protection monitoring. In each community, 5 community members will be interviewed on a monthly basis with all data collected fed back to the PMTF. All monitoring activities will be overseen by Shafak’s Senior Protection Monitoring Coordinator in Gaziantep.  The information collected will allow Shafak teams on the ground to better understand the needs of beneficiaries and be able to offer appropriate support or referrals. In addition, all data will be analysed and compiled in to reports that will be shared with the PMTF, Protection Cluster Sub-Clusters and humanitarian actors. This information can then be used to better understand protection gaps and improve future programming. It will also be used in advocacy initiatives.

A referral mechanism will be established whereby those who are identified as being particularly vulnerable, can seek additional protection or support in accordance with international best practice for services and protection intervention. This process is already underway in Rural Damascus where both HALO and Shafak are working to develop relationships with other humanitarian actors, notably with Handicap International.

Given the volatile security situation in Rural Damascus, it is important that there is contingency plan . If Rural Damascus becomes inaccessible, proposition is that projects moves to Areha and Jisr Ashogour in Southern Idleb. HALO would also consider moving the project to Rural Hama where there is reportedly a gap in existing services. Both are areas in which Shafak already operates."

The overall goal of the project is to improve the physical protective environment and increase humanitarian access through the removal and clearance of hazardous areas. DDG will deploy a Multi-Task Team (MTT) capable of conducting Battle Area Clearance (BAC) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) to enhance safety and freedom of movement across Magwi and Lainya Counties. Both Magwi and Lainya Counties are locations which serve as potential transit routes and initial locations for spontaneous returnees arriving back from Uganda. The project target group will be 8,000 men, women, boys, and girls living in or using areas contaminated by explosive remnants of war (ERW) and tasks which will support the multi-sector humanitarian response in the area will be prioritised. 

The respective activities proposed under this project are further elaborated below:

BAC - the MTT will be able to act as a BAC capacity, performing static clearance activities across larger, clearly defined areas (identified through the above data collection activities and technical survey as appropriate). The MTT will be trained in Manual Mine Clearance (MMC) drills, to prepare for the event that a mine is identified within any given BAC site. 

EOD – where DDG receives request to support from humanitarian actors, or immediate threats to life, technical capacities within the team will be deployed to mark identified hazards. 

DDG will initiate the project by deploying the team to Magwi town where a light base camp will be established, and training and accreditation will take place. Magwi County will remain the focus for this project, in line with Mine Action Sub Cluster priorities, with the option to deploy to Lainya County based on identified need throughout the project’s duration.

Working with implementing partner Shafak, HALO will train three existing Risk Education teams (two of which were based in Eastern Ghouta prior to relocation in early 2018) to conduct additional Contamination Impact and Casualty Survey activities. The teams will operate in Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps and host communities in A’zaz and Al Bab with emphasis on targeting groups who are particularly vulnerable to explosive hazards such as ‘people on the move’ and children. 

Each team will comprise five team members one team leader, one deputy team leader and three team members. All team members will be trained by HALO in Risk Education, Contamination Impact Survey and Casualty Survey. 

Risk Education will be conducted in IDP camps and host communities. Whilst the sessions will be open to all community members, the teams will be placing particular emphasis on reaching those who are most at risk of accident, including children, young men and IDPs who may not be familiar with the type of threat present in the area. The sessions will be held in both schools and community spaces. The teams will also distribute flyers and posters with Risk Education messaging to reach the wider community. 

To better understand the threat that explosive hazards pose in the area, HALO will also conduct systematic Contamination Impact Survey. Under this activity, the teams will visit communities and identify the type and level of contamination present. This information will be collected on an existing HALO ERW database and be used to create maps and identify areas of highest priority for Risk Education and future ERW clearance. 

Additionally, the teams will collect information about accidents and accident victims through Casualty Survey activities. To do this, the teams will visit local hospitals and medical centres who will direct them toward victims, or the families of victims who are willing to share information about accidents. The team members will be trained to conduct comprehensive victim interviews. Information collected through Casualty Survey will be used in several ways firstly, it will be used by HALO to map areas with high rates of accident, indicating areas of high priority. Secondly, it will provide a better understanding of how and why accidents are occurring, enabling HALO, and other actors, to better tailor Risk Education and victim assistance activities. Finally, with permission, collected data will be shared with other humanitarian actors providing rehabilitation or medical care for follow-up assistance. 

A referral mechanism will be established whereby those who are identified as being particularly vulnerable, can seek additional protection or support in accordance with international best practice for services and protection intervention. This process is already underway in the area where both HALO and Shafak have worked to develop relationships with other humanitarian actors, notably with Humanity and Inclusion."

It reflects lessons learned from HALO’s experience in NW Syria since 2016 amp consultation with the Mine Action Sub-Cluster (MASC), CCCM, Health amp Education clusters amp OCHA’s Access Working Group.

HALO will deliver a 12-month response, through direct implementation amp support from an implementing partner (iMFAD). The project includes Risk Education (RE), Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) Enhanced Contamination Impact Survey (ECIS), Victim Data Collection (VDC) amp Victim Assistance (VA) referral case management in selected districts across opposition-controlled areas of Idleb/western Aleppo amp Turkish-controlled areas of Aleppo. HALO will cover opposition-controlled areas, iMFAD will cover Turkish-controlled areas. The response is identical in both areas. Field staff will also be trained to deliver community COVID-19 awareness messaging consistent with WHO guidance. The project concept of operations is at Annex A (slide 8).

HALO will strengthen its presence in Gaziantep, reducing its presence in Amman. Project staff is 52 – 19 funded at 100% (HALO: 7, iMFAD: 6, contracted drivers: 6) - all in Syria amp 33 funded under shared arrangements (HALO: 23, iMFAD: 10). 32 of 52 staff are in NW Syria. The project organogram is at Annex B.

According to the 2020 HNO, ERW contamination increased by 29% from 2018 to 2019, with communities most at risk located near the frontlines of conflict and in urban centres. HALO’s extensive amp ongoing ECIS work in NW Syria confirms the ongoing threat posed by ERW. With official ERW disposal yet to commence in NW Syria, RE continues to plays a critical role in improving awareness amp reinforcing safe behavior amongst children amp adults.

2 x 5-person Community Liaison Teams (CLTs) (1 x HALO, 1 x iMFAD) will deliver standardized 30-40 min community-based RE sessions to children and adults, with content consistent with MASC key messaging. The priority will be IDPs in preparation for return to contaminated home communities. CLTs will also deliver training to Community Focal Points (CFPs) amp NGO Focal Points across all humanitarian sectors to improve the integration and reach of RE messaging. The total target is 19,760 beneficiaries (9,690 children, 9,690 adults amp 380 CFPs/NGO Focal Points). Beneficiary calculations are at Annex C.

CLTs will also provide ECIS support upon request (from other humanitarian actors amp local authorities) to identify, mark, report amp map ERW contamination in targeted districts. This activity is a continuation of HALO’s ERW survey work in NW Syria, which is scheduled to be completed by 31 Aug 2020. 

Additionally, 3 x VA Case Management staff (2 x HALO, 1 x iMFAD), with support from CLTs, will collect amp analyse victim/survivor data from ERW amp other conflict-related accidents in order to identify referral requirements to specialised services. Case Management staff will ensure effective referral to relevant support services (as available), including transportation, amp maintain a relationship with referred beneficiaries throughout the process. This activity will enhance the resilience of people living with injuries amp disabilities (PLWD) and will complement other HALO projects with VA components (e.g. physiotherapy, prosthetics, psychosocial support, multi-purpose assistance). These efforts improve successful referral rates for survivors needing assistance, which indirectly relieves pressure on the Health cluster amp other clusters. The target is 285 interviews with a 50% successful referral rate for victims/survivors requiring assistance.

The project will be led by the combined HALO/iMFAD project office in Gaziantep, supported directly by HALO staff in Amman amp iMFAD staff in Balikesir. All field activities will be coordinated from HALO's Operation room in Amman.

The prioritized need in this regard is to sustain the functionality of the referral system through the provision of the fuel for 60 ambulances within the central referral system in northern Syria as well as enhancing the referral data management unit (RDMU) as a main unit in the Health Information System (HIS) to ensure the sustainability and quality of health services, as follows:
-	Securing the fuel for 60 ambulances for emergency cases and to operate 4 cold cases vehicles to transfer patients who need non-emergency medical consultations or referred between the HFs across different levels of healthcare for further medical investigations or treatment. Under the referral component, capacity building for the referral focal points of 75 HFs will be done to include them in the central referral system's direct coordination and supervision mechanism. Where the central referral network will coordinate referrals through 60 ambulances and 4 cars to transport cold cases between 75 health facilities distributed in Idlib, Hama, and Aleppo governorates at a rate of 3,600 referrals per month.
-	Supporting and expanding the Referral Data Management Unit (RDMU) of the Central Health Information System specialized in collecting, processing, and analyzing referral system data. This will be in coordination with the WHO three networks: Harim, Afrin, and Northern Aleppo. The data of 24,000 referred cases from 65 different health facilities will be reported to the RDMU within HIS during the proposed period of the project.

"736";"crs_XM-OCHA-CBPF-AFG-16/3481/SA1/N/INGO/486";"This proposal is designed to follow up and build on the accumulated field experience and lessons learnt from the first 2 phases of AHF-funded project with regards to: partnership management, standardization of assessment tools, experience of collecting multi-sectorial indicators using Integrated SMART methodology existence of national guidelines for conducting rapid nutrition assessments and presence of trained members of AIM-WG. Since 2014 ACF managed to conduct standardized integrated assessments in 71 districts spreading across 12 provinces of Afghanistan. Beside the nutrition-related indicators, these assessments allowed to collect population-based multi-sector indicators. These assessments served the twofold purpose of informing proposals and new interventions’ design with recent, consistent, and reliable data, thus helping the interventions to be in line with real needs and priorities. The most significant gap in the humanitarian coordination is the lack of a harmonized assessment approach, and the “silo thinking” with regards to data collection and sharing. This contributes to uncoordinated, incomplete or inaccurate cross-cutting data. In the absence of complete data to inform policy-makers, donors, and implementing partners’ decisions, the risk of inappropriate or inefficient allocation of resources is high, and has an impact on the quality and scope of the humanitarian assistance. Moreover, the capacity to rapidly respond to the needs of vulnerable populations is limited, mostly due to challenges common to rapid assessments and to the fact that the tools and methodologies used by different agencies to collect the same information are not standardized. In light of the above, the proposed project aims at providing a solid basis for comprehensive multi-sector programs to be implemented in Afghanistan. ACF considers that this can be done through the regular collection of relevant data that are informative, harmonized, updated, reliable as well as effectively and efficiently disseminated. An important feature is the capacity of multi-sector actors to conduct quality coordinated assessments on a regular basis, while advocating for these findings to be taken into consideration during decision/policy making processes. ACF will focus on dissemination of the surveys’ findings within the concerned actors, as timely information sharing is the main way to enhance coordination and strategic planning of the humanitarian intervention, and avoid overlapping, gaps, and the waste of precious resources.  This project aims at strengthening the coordinated assessments, with the adoption of multi-sector standardized methodologies to collect and analyze indicators from multiple sectors in a timely, accurate and reliable way to inform action and program design at 2 critical levels: at the provincial level, where they will help inform the right combination of responses and  at the national level, where they will highly contribute to the national level HNO’s mapping of vulnerabilities and needs, and costs estimation
Strategically, these integrated assessments are expected to substantially contribute to the Nutrition, WASH, FSAC and Health clusters by providing key information and data that can be used for decision making
ACF will support local BPHS partners in the conduction of 8 Integrated SMART surveys and 5 Rapid SMARTs in 8 priority provinces and 5 emergency affected zones within the next 12 months starting in July 2016. ACF also aims to strengthen the capacity of key stakeholders and implementing partners through on-the-job trainings offered at national and provincial primarily targeting field level staff, while providing direct technical and financial support for the implementation of the integrated surveys/evaluations. ACF also plans to establish a Rapid Nutrition Assessment Team under the patronage of the AIM-WG in the PND of the MoPH, to rapidly mobilize teams for rapid or ad-hoc assessments when and where needed."

 a) Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE)
 b) EORE Trainer of Trainer (ToT) training
 c) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and
 d) Non-Technical Survey (NTS) 

These activities will be conducted in selected sub-districts across opposition-controlled areas of Idleb and western Aleppo and across Turkish-administered areas of northern Aleppo. HALO will deliver EORE and ToT training in opposition-controlled areas and iMFAD will deliver EOD and NTS in Turkish-administered areas. EORE field staff will be trained to deliver community COVID-19 awareness messaging consistent with WHO guidance.

Explosive Risk Ordnance Education and Train the Trainer Training
One five-person Community Liaison Team (CLT) under HALO will deliver 30-40 minute community-based risk education sessions to children and adults across Idleb, Harim and Jisr-Ash-Shugur districts.

There are issues related to the harmonization and consistency of financial information with sustainability reporting in general, and further issues with regard to aligning sustainability reporting with the SDGs monitoring framework and its indicators. However, many countries lack the institutional and technical capacity to adapt their corporate reporting environments to the new demands spurred by the 2030 Agenda and effectively assess the private sector contribution towards attaining the SDGs.

In this context, the project's goals are to:
- Develop and implement a mechanism to coordinate efforts among different national authorities in establishing a sustainability reporting framework.
- Help companies prepare and publish useful sustainability reports within that framework.
- Support Governments in the collection of comparable and reliable information on companies' contribution towards the SDG implementation aligned with the global framework of SDG indicators.

At the heart of this mechanism is the integration of financial and non-financial information as part of companies’ reporting cycles.

The project will improve quality and facilitate international comparability of sustainability reporting, as well as enable multiple authorities within Governments to articulate, collaborate, and better assess the private sector contribution towards attaining the SDGs. Ultimately, the project will enhance the SDG monitoring mechanism."

The expected result will be an enhanced capacity of national statistical authorities to collate and disseminate data and statistics for policy makers for more gender-responsive trade policy and to analyse the gendered impacts of COVID-19 transferred via trade.

In the longer term, the project will enable a more coherent review of progress towards inclusive trade policy and equitable economic development as part of the 2030 Agenda.

The project aims at developing the existing statistical data on employment, wages and salaries, as well as turnover, productivity and profitability of businesses from the gender perspective. These data also enable the assessment of the effects of COVID-19 through trade, including by different types of businesses, i.e. SMEs, and by gender. The project will advance the use of evidence as a basis of gender-responsive trade policy and in support of the economic and social recovery from COVID-19."

- Improve the participating countries' capacity to measure IFFs over time, and monitor the impact of policies put in place to reduce these flows.

NSO is responsible for the collection, compilation and dissemination of all social and economic statistics. Other departments in the Central Government have very few personnel with the knowledge of statistics. Situation of statistical functionaries in other department is no different. There is lack of allocation of resources for statistical activities in the departments other than NSO. NSO does not have any unit or staff to take agriculture statistics related activities. The statistics system in PNG suffers from both lack of resources both manpower and training to personnel to carry out effective work of agriculture data collection. An agriculture census has not been conducted in PNG for more than 40 years. This lack of baseline agricultural statistics poses a severe challenge for the Government to monitor and evaluate the impacts of agricultural projects and national development indicators in the agricultural and rural development sector. It also compromises the ability of the Government to monitor progress against relevant Sustainable Development Goals. FAO, in partnership with the World Bank, the United Nations Statistical Commission, and in in consultation with national institutions developed the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics. The IdCA preparation work under the Global Strategy project for PNG was undertaken in two phases. Based on the work in the two missions, an IdCA report for PNG was prepared, an identified the main areas for technical assistance and training including the following: ? Technical support for data processing and analysis of data collected from Demographic and Health Survey relating to (i) Estimation of Crop production, area etc.; and (ii) Food security; and ? Technical assistance for preparation of framework for conduct of Agricultural Census; and This TCP provides technical assistance and training for areas identified above, and aims to strengthen the capacity of relevant government agencies in PNG to process and analyse agricultural statistics."

"2053";"survey_9133";"(1) Statistical Information Systems. The diagnostic will be conducted to determine the priority demand of information for economic and social policy design, monitoring and evaluation. This will involve consultations with users, both in the public and private sectors. With a better sense of the demand for and utilization of statistical information, an action plan will be developed to ensure statistical production is aligned with the priority demands identified by key users.(2) Systems of Statistical Production. The NSDS also will produce a detailed assessment of the current statistical system, preferably, using an assessment framework such as the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), identifying strengths and weaknesses, and looking at all aspects of activities from the quality of the output to aspects such as finance and management. This diagnostic also should explore the 5.1 regulating the production of statistics and efficiency issues regarding statistical production. It would evaluate the relevance of the information provided by the system and assess satisfied and unsatisfied demands for statistics. Consideration should be given to new areas of information needed and the strengthening of regional statistical capabilities. (3) Coordination among Producer and User Agencies. The proposed NSDS will try to optimize the use of existing funds by improving inter-agency coordination. In particular, the NSDS will review the coordination mechanisms between line ministries and the DGEEC with the aim of establishing protocols and regulating these interactions. Management functions among key producers and users of statistics will be further strengthened to rationalize and streamline the statistical functions of various stakeholders. As part of the effort to improve inter-institutional coordination, a planning workshop will be held among the producers and users of the national statistical system, led by the DGEEC. This workshop will bring the stakeholders to the same table to discuss approaches to the development of the NSDS. It also will allow the DGEEC the ability to gauge the current supply and demand conditions of statistical information within the National Statistical System (NSS). (4) Dissemination and Adoption. Following the preparation of the strategy, the NSDS will be reviewed by external reviewers and validated through a user/producer workshop. The NSDS will seek to be endorsed by the Board of Statistics and approved by the Cabinet. Commitments to financing (and abiding by) the NSDS will be sought from multilateral and bilateral organization and from the Government (high level approval).To facilitate dissemination and adoption, audiovisual materials will be produced, as well as a printed version of the Paraguayan NSDS to share with a wider and more general audience."

"2733";"survey_10565";"Swaziland faces the challenge of inadequate health and community systems capacity to support an effective response that includes scaling-up and strengthening existing interventions. One of the most important factors that affects access to prevention, treatment and care services for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria and other health programs in Swaziland is the production, attrition and deployment of health workers. A health workforce assessment conducted by the European Union in 2007, found that the overall number of medical personnel declined by nearly 13 percent over the preceding two years. These losses are particularly severe in the rural areas of Swaziland. Limited capacity of nursing training facilities, lengthy hiring processes, growing burden on existing staff and poor supervision in the regional areas are some of the key reasons for shortages of health staff. The cross-cutting HSS Program proposes to address these shortages through strengthening the health workforce, improving service delivery and enhancing monitoring and information systems. Staff shortages in the health sector will be addressed through improvement in recruitment and worker retention policies, health workforce wellness programs and the expansion of human resource capacity in the health sector. The Program will improve service delivery and accessibility by capacity building and decentralizing services such as HIV care and treatment, the provision of Antenatal Care services (ANC), Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs, and TB diagnosis at the clinic level. Diagnostic services are currently concentrated in the national hospitals and diagnostic centers which are less accessible to vulnerable and rural populations.Moreover, the inability of the national health information system to routinely provide the data necessary for effective monitoring and evaluation of disease-specific programs has led to the development of parallel systems of data collection. The Program will focus on the creation of a common national database which will facilitate access to information and a harmonized monitoring and evaluation system. The integrated monitoring and evaluation system will also incorporate data generated by community-based and private sector monitoring and evaluation systems into the overall national health information system. These interventions will strengthen data collection from two sectors with historically weak monitoring and evaluation functions in Swaziland and add to the completeness of the national health information system."

This assessment is intended to measure the causal effects of the participation of children and young people in terms of cognitive and emotional skills. About 3,000 applicants between 6 and 14 years old were randomly divided between treatment group (participants in orchestras from academic year 2012-13) and control group (with deferred share offer of a year, that is to from the academic year 2013-14). Data from the baseline have been raised in the fourth quarter of 2012 by the International Joint Venture firm SEI-Econometrics.The new technical cooperation (valued at $ 990.000) has two objectives. First, it provides finance the follow-up survey, necessary to measure the impact of a year of participation in the system by comparing the treatment group with the control group in terms of indicators of socio-cognitive skills. Second, it proposes to finance the completion of the measurement package, and its extension to young people between 12 and 24 years old (or older children incorporated into the impact assessment of the system). This package represents a public good that can be used inside and outside the Bank to measure the impact of programs for youth at risk.The CT would have three main products: 1) tracking poll, 2) impact study, 3) battery of youth."

The urgency for such is increasing as the Bank extends, for example, social and labor programs to other countries in the Region without the benefit of adequate information. This crucial information can be provided, in part, by household surveys. The purpose of this Regional TC --that includes The Bahamas, Barbados and Jamaica-- is to provide the information required for evidence-based social cum labor policy making in the Caribbean by relaxing three critical bottlenecks: (i) lack of data to support empirical analysis hindering the design of targeted public labor and social policies; (ii) constrained capacity to measure results and learning process; and (iii) inadequate sharing of experiences among countries. Easing these bottlenecks could help catalyze broader policy and institutional reforms."

Such an infrastructure will promote integration from and for the private sector, allowing SMEs to move from the margins to the mainstream of international value chains.CA is being developed and launched in a very favorable context thanks to the solid growth of intra-regional trade and investment in LAC, and the increased use of technology and Internet tools by SMEs. In fact, LAC is experiencing unprecedented growth in trade and investment. Between 1990 and 2010, intra-regional trade grew tenfold, approximately from USD 18 billion to USD 180 billion. In addition, although the vast majority of companies in the region are SMEs (at least 3.7 million with 5 employees or more) only 13% of all LAC firms export. This scenario provides powerful reasons to deepen the integration efforts and overcome the barriers that SMEs are facing when they attempt to integrate into regional and global markets. Finally, SMEs in LAC are taking more and more advantage of the possibilities opened by the Internet. A recent study by Google showed that Internet usage in the region grew nearly 891% between 2000 and 2009, 86% of the companies surveyed had a proprietary website, and spend resources in online advertising."

"2989";"survey_11103";"Swaziland faces the challenge of inadequate health and community systems capacity to support an effective response that includes scaling-up and strengthening existing interventions. One of the most important factors that affects access to prevention, treatment and care services for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria and other health programs in Swaziland is the production, attrition and deployment of health workers. A health workforce assessment conducted by the European Union in 2007, found that the overall number of medical personnel declined by nearly 13 percent over the preceding two years. These losses are particularly severe in the rural areas of Swaziland. Limited capacity of nursing training facilities, lengthy hiring processes, growing burden on existing staff and poor supervision in the regional areas are some of the key reasons for shortages of health staff. The cross-cutting HSS Program proposes to address these shortages through strengthening the health workforce, improving service delivery and enhancing monitoring and information systems. Staff shortages in the health sector will be addressed through improvement in recruitment and worker retention policies, health workforce wellness programs and the expansion of human resource capacity in the health sector.  The Program will improve service delivery and accessibility by capacity building and decentralizing services such as HIV care and treatment, the provision of Antenatal Care services (ANC), Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs, and TB diagnosis at the clinic level. Diagnostic services are currently concentrated in the national hospitals and diagnostic centers which are less accessible to vulnerable and rural populations.Moreover, the inability of the national health information system to routinely provide the data necessary for effective monitoring and evaluation of disease-specific programs has led to the development of parallel systems of data collection. The Program will focus on the creation of a common national database which will facilitate access to information and a harmonized monitoring and evaluation system. The integrated monitoring and evaluation system will also incorporate data generated by community-based and private sector monitoring and evaluation systems into the overall national health information system. These interventions will strengthen data collection from two sectors with historically weak monitoring and evaluation functions in Swaziland and add to the completeness of the national health information system."

This will include ecosystem mapping, enumeration of ecosystem services, and existence of biodiversity. Environmental economists will be hired as consultants to conduct the economic valuation study. These consultants will design a survey and the local environmental NGO will execute the survey that will provide information for the economic valuation study. The results of the economic valuation study will feed into the economic feasibility analysis of the loan.

The project is expected to produce benefits for remote rural populations as well as the national and international population. The outcome will be the environment for safe and economic shipping routes provided by NMSA. Outputs: Outputs include (i) replaced, installed and maintained navaids, (ii) improved safety information infrastructure, (iii) improved maritime safety practice of communities, and (iv) efficient project management and capacity development provided. Output 1: Replaced, installed and maintained navaids. NMSA will replace 99 existing navaids and install 33 additional navaids. These are outlined in the NMSA's work plan with site selection criteria. To determine priorities, the plan uses engineering aspects, including relationship with PNG's existing navaids network, ship traffic density, and environmental condition. The proposed project will conduct a feasibility study that includes investigation of the navaids' local environment and conduct due diligence assessments. Where a need is identified, engineering design will incorporate measures for adapting to climate change impacts to ensure sustainable maintenance. Communities will participates in a community engagement program to monitor and secure good condition of navaids based on the practice of the previous project. Output 2: Improved safety information infrastructure. NMSA will produce a modern series of paper and electronic navigational charts (ENC) after recompiling existing PNG navigational chart portfolios in cooperation with Australian Hydrographic Service (AHS). [NMSA and Australian Hydrographic Service have a partnership to conduct hydrographic surveys and produce navigational charts]. NMSA will contract out a large scale hydrographic survey and provide data to AHS for producing nautical charts and ENC for seven ports. [ Kulili Harbour; Schlangen Harbor, Wasu; Bugoiya Harbor, Misima Island; Panabwal Group; Deboyne Islands; Yanaba Island, Egum Atoll; and Dawson Strait]. Also, NMSA will extend the automatic identification system (AIS) network by installing AIS transponders and base stations in at least five sites and relocating three existing stations. The project will confirm details and configuration of each site prior to the commencement of civil works. Also, tide gauges will be installed in four major ports to measure changes in the sea level and contribute to the growing database of climate change and sea level rise information. Output 3: Improved maritime safety practice of communities. NMSA will provide maritime safety awareness activities among the general public and in targeted rural and remote communities to change people's perceptions about maritime safety and improve small craft safety practices.

Subprogram 1, implemented in 2007 2008, included a policy-based grant, a project grant supporting the development of information technology systems for effective implementation of reforms, and a TA grant to help prepare subprogram 2. Preparation and implementation of subprogram 2 has also benefited from and reinforced other interventions.  The reforms supported under subprogram 2 build on the achievements made under subprogram 1 despite difficult political and external conditions. They address binding constraints to private sector development and diversification in the areas of business regulation and taxation, access to finance, worker skills development, and public private partnerships (PPPs). The relevance of these constraints has been confirmed through recent studies and surveys, which explain some deviations from the constraints originally identified in 2008. Subprogram 2 is effectively gender mainstreamed to maximize benefits to women. The reform agenda that remains after subprogram 2 will be addressed under subprogram 3. Subprogram 2 complements the efforts of (i) ADB and other development partners to strengthen physical infrastructure and improve access to finance; and (ii) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rebuild fiscal buffers and safeguard monetary stability, which are important for a healthy business and investment climate. Improving the investment climate for the private sector is critical for the government s economic growth policies.  Subprogram 2 contributes toward this end. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic emphasizes improving the business climate.  ADB s country operations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic identifies subprogram 2 as a means of broadening the Kyrgyz economy and its private sector."

For inclusive development leaving no one behind, the census is an ideal vehicle for data collection. As censuses embody total coverage of a country, they are a vital source of data that can be disaggregated by age, sex, geography, disability status, and socio-economic characteristics for comparative analysis of the situation of persons with and without disabilities in terms of equalization of opportunities. In this respect, country participation in the 2020 census round is very important. In the context of collecting adequate and relevant data for all inclusive development planning and monitoring taking into account the situation of persons with disabilities, it is equally important that countries also plan for and conduct more detailed studies mainly through sample surveys. A review of experiences of countries in collecting data on disability through censuses and surveys will be necessary in order to identify good practices and also challenges that countries still face in this regard so that, if necessary revisions/updates can be done on existing international guidelines for disability measurement. Also in the context of reviewing past national experiences it will be important for UNSD to collect, collate and disseminate disability data that countries have collected during censuses of the 2010 round and also through recent sample household surveys and other nationally-representative data sources. 18.
