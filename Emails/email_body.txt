Dear XXX, 

As you may know, we are currently reviewing the methodology we used in identifying data and statistical projects for our PRESS report and Clearinghouse workstreams. 

The methodology enables us to automatically identify statistical projects from over 3,000,000 development financing activities around the world.  

Now, this methodology needs your help to become smarter. 

We have found nearly 800 different descriptions belonging to projects that are marked by donors as “Statistical capacity development”. However, many of these descriptions are results of bad reporting, i.e. they are not necessarily describing statistical projects! 

As our methodology looks for similar descriptions in un-marked projects, it would be much more accurate if you can kindly help us eliminate these bad reports. The request is simple: 

The document attached to this email contains 20 project descriptions. It would be great if you can mark in the document if you think they are a project on data and statistics. 

We would be much grateful if you can send back your answer by Friday COB. Feel free to let us know if you have any questions!

Kind regards, 
Yu and Johannes
