When working with excels necessary to always keep the db_ref until the end 
Also it is important to keep the functions in the cells until the end. 

What we did during the excel manual simplification: 
remove africa regional projects
remove projects committed before 2018 because they also ended before that

it is possible to merge projects with same project numbers. For multilaterals who didn't provide project numbers, it is possible to look at project names and do the merging. 


Took me almost 4 hours. For countries with more projects, it could take longer. 
Data analysis only took one hour, it's the filling that took longer time. 
Therefore, it also makes sense to develop some code to do the calculation. 
Also, the structure of the excel was too long, another reason to have code for this work.
